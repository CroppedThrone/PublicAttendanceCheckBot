## What can you do with this discord bot?
With this discord bot let a bot count attendances so you don't have to count it yourself.
You can add your ranks, rank requirements, roles that will give people access to commands and so much more!

## Update 0.1
You can now organise people with the /Give_Ordered_List by using "checkrequirement". This will allow you to only see the people who have enough attendances to rank up.
