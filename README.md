## What can you do with this discord bot?
With this discord bot let a bot count attendances so you don't have to count it yourself.
You can add your ranks, rank requirements, roles that will give people access to commands and so much more!

## Update 0.11
You can now organise people with the /Give_Ordered_List by using "checkrequirement". This will allow you to only see the people who have enough attendances to rank up.
You can now use the command: /settings_auto_clear_attendances

## Commands list (needs to update)

#### /settings_auto_clear_attendances: 
When the user uses "/reset_attendance_list". You can automatically clear the attendance text channel when you also reset the attendance list. there are also 4 modes you can use: Clear all messages, Clear all messages except admins, Only clear attendance messages & Don't clear messages. Don't clear messages is the default.
